- **Find Min and Max (Array)**: Finds the minimum and maximum values in an integer array.
- **Reverse Array**: Reverses the elements of an integer array.
- **Find Min and Max (Linked List)**: Finds the minimum and maximum values in a linked list.
- **Reverse Linked List**: Reverses the elements of a linked list.

## Usage
